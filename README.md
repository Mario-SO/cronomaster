# ⏰ Toastmasters Timer App

Welcome to the **Toastmasters Timer App**! 🎤 This app helps you track the speaking times during your Toastmasters sessions ⏳. Let's ensure everyone sticks to their time limits in a fun and visually appealing way!

## 🚀 Features

-  **Start/Stop Timers**: Each timer can be individually started or paused ⏯️.
-  **Multiple Roles**: Track time for various roles such as Toastmaster, Muletillas, Charla, Evaluador, and more 🎭.
-  **Visual Cues**: Watch the dots change size and pulse as you reach your speaking milestones 🟢🟡🔴.

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Start a Timer**: Click the play button next to any role to start the timer ▶️. If another timer is already running, it will pause automatically ⏸️.
2. **Track Time for Multiple Roles**: The app supports multiple roles and tracks each timer individually 👥.
3. **Visual Feedback**: Colored dots provide visual feedback:
    - **Green Dot** turns larger and pulses when the minimum time is reached 🟢.
    - **Yellow Dot** does the same for the medium time 🟡.
    - **Red Dot** indicates the maximum time reached and pulses for urgency 🔴.
